# Lunar_Lander

## Lunar Lander Game 
In this project, the goal is to build an RL agent that can successfully land the “Luna Lander” in the lunar lander
environment from OpenAI gym. The problem consists of 8-dimensional continuous state space and 4 discrete
action space. This game is an episodic task, the episode ends when the lander either crashes or land successfully,
receiving -100 and 100 score respectively. It is possible for the lander to land outside of the landing pad and the
lander has infinite fuel. The problem is considered solved when achieve a score of 200 points or higher on
average over 100 consecutive runs. See below table for detailed states, actions rewards description.
